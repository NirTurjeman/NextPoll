Project Description:
This project is a digital voting system developed in C with the aim of improving the voting experience, streamlining voting processes, and verifying results in local authority elections. 
The system was designed with a focus on user-friendliness, data integrity, and security.

System Features:
* Voter Identification and Authentication: Secure login process with voter identity verification.
* Candidate Selection: Simple and user-friendly interface for choosing preferred candidates.
* Vote Submission: Allows voters to submit their votes in a secure and protected manner.
* Vote Counting and Results Presentation: Fast and advanced vote counting process, with real-time results display.

Technologies and Programming:
During the development of the system, advanced programming techniques in C were used, including efficient and secure data structure management for storing information about voters and candidates.
Throughout the project, I faced challenges such as developing an easy-to-use user interface and conducting tests to ensure the system's compliance with security and operational requirements.

Running the project:
To run the project you must run it in one of your preferred development environments,
To activate the system, you must upload it in one of the two options:
* Upload the files from a text file.
* Upload the files from a binary file
After that there are several options as "System Viewer", for example:
* Adding a citizen / candidate / party member
* System printing
* Search from the list of voters
* Option to check an ID card according to an algorithm I built that knows how to identify a valid Israeli ID card according to special parameters.

After that, a login system will open that will appear to the user, this system knows how to analyze the type of user (citizen/voter/candidate/administrator) by ID
According to the following analysis, the appropriate menu will open to the user.

Special highlights we put in the project:
* We gave a nice reference to connecting according to user type, according to an ID card check in several aspects.
* We gave reference to negating load on the system by allocating voting times to each voter, thus solving the possibility of the system collapsing in times of stress
* Reference was made to data analysis and access to the candidate at any given moment.
* Easy and clear interface for voters.
*In this system we worked with a database of citizens whose age is automatically updated according to their date of birth so that the system always remains up to date
